# vivid-bindings-vue
Fully automated typescript bindings for Vivid web components to be used in VueJS

# Rationale

Vivid web components since version 3.0 are shipped with the meta data alongside the code itself.
Which allows to employ code generation practice to build 100% automated typescript type safe bindings for VueJs components

# Manual bindings approach
